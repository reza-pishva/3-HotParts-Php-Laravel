        periodic repairs or special repairs, it is necessary for expert groups from different companies to enter the
        power plant

        operation of control systems in different parts of the power plant, so the entry of these devices into the power
        plant should be accompanied by careful monitoring, for example, if the presence of these people requires some
        points. It should be safe before the presence of these people Safety items in the application forms of the
        presence of these people to be specified so that before the start of the activity of these people in the power
        plant to be trained by the safety unit. In addition to the period of time when these people are allowed to be
        present at the power plant, the places where they can be present must also be known in advance to the power
        plant officials.

        units seemed necessary. In the management software of people entering and leaving the power plant, it is
        possible for each part of the power plant to fill out a request form for the presence of people from outside the
        power plant, and this request form is sent to these departments in a fully mechanized manner for approval by
        managers of different departments. After obtaining the necessary approvals, the person or persons will be
        allowed to enter the power plant. Through this software, it is possible to register the reason for the presence
        of this person and the company that works there, along with other details such as phone number and email
        address. There are others that can be very useful for future reference to these people or companies. This
        software includes various sections such as various reports and also forms to determine the names of people and
        tools and cars and so on.In this sofware project I have used php and its framework laravel in server side and in
        client side I have used HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Javascript,jQuery and Ajax techniques. Database that I have used in
        this project was mySql.
